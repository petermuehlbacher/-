# 鰐蟹具—WaniKani tools

So far there is only one quick and dirty solution for ordering vocab by the absolute number of
(i.e. not percentage of) incorrect answers.

For a preview (/my personal wall of shame) take a look at the corresponding [IPython notebook](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petermuehlbacher/WaniKani/blob/master/orderWKbyerrors.html),
the source can be found [here](https://github.com/petermuehlbacher/WaniKani/blob/master/orderWKbyerrors.py).
