# 鰐蟹具—WaniKani tools

So far there is only one quick and dirty solution for ordering vocab by the
absolute number of (i.e. not percentage of) incorrect answers. The
`correct_threshold` variable can be used to ignore the vocabulary items that
have been answered correctly the last `correct_threshold` times (both reading
and meaning).

For a preview (/my personal wall of shame) take a look at the corresponding
[IPython notebook](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petermuehlbacher/WaniKani/blob/master/orderWKbyerrors.html), the source can be found [here](https://github.com/petermuehlbacher/WaniKani/blob/master/orderWKbyerrors.py).
